# studentlifeproject
A social networking app that allows students to rate professors. 
The student might sign up or login and rate the professorâ€™s easiness, etc. 
The messages and comments are saved in a MongoDB NoSQL database.


I converted the application from a Spring Application to a Spring Boot application.
